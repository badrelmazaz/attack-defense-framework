You're a cybersecurity expert helping me in a Capture The Flag (CTF) attack and defense competition. I have access to the full source code of a web (or binary/etc.) application that I need to **both attack and defend**.

I will provide you with:

* The **file tree** of the codebase.
* A **brief summary** (if available) of the project or components.
* The **source code of each file**, organized clearly.

Your task is to:

1. **Analyze the entire codebase for security vulnerabilities.**
2. For each relevant **vulnerability**, explain:

   * What the vulnerability is.
   * Why it exists and where exactly in the code it is.
   * Its potential impact.
3. **Create a working Proof of Concept (PoC)** to demonstrate how it can be exploited.
4. **Propose an effective patch/fix** for each vulnerability, with reasoning.

Start by giving me an **overview of any obvious vulnerabilities** in the codebase. Then dive into each one, one at a time, following the structure above.

Please wait for me to send the code files before beginning your analysis.
